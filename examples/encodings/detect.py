"""
This example tries to detect the file encoding using chardet. You can install
chardet by running the following commmand::

    pip install chardet

.. note:: If you run this example without supplying a file argument, it will
    open a fallback file encoded with a chinese encoding. Chardet will not
    detect the right encoding but the file will load without any errors.

    I made this example to show you that you should not rely on a charset
    detector but instead provided a way for the user to reload the file with
    another encoding. This can be done using the EncodingMenu (in
    pyqode.core.widgets).
